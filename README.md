Description: - `days_of_week` - (Required) A list of Days of the Week on which this schedule will be used. Possible values are `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, and `Sunday`
- `name` - (Required) The name of the schedule.
- `off_peak_load_balancing_algorithm` - (Required) The load Balancing Algorithm to use during Off-Peak Hours. Possible values are `DepthFirst` and `BreadthFirst`.
- `off_peak_start_time` - (Required) The time at which Off-Peak scaling will begin. This is also the end-time for the Ramp-Down period. The time must be specified in "HH:MM" format.

- `ramp_down_capacity_threshold_percent` - (Required) This is the value in percentage of used host pool capacity that will be considered to evaluate whether to turn on/off virtual machines during the ramp-down and off-peak hours. For example, if capacity threshold is specified as 60% and your total host pool capacity is 100 sessions, autoscale will turn on additional session hosts once the host pool exceeds a load of 60 sessions.
- `ramp_down_force_logoff_users` - (Required) Whether users will be forced to log-off session hosts once the `ramp_down_wait_time_minutes` value has been exceeded during the Ramp-Down period. Possible
- `ramp_down_load_balancing_algorithm` - (Required) The load Balancing Algorithm to use during the Ramp-Down period. Possible values are `DepthFirst` and `BreadthFirst`.

- `ramp_down_stop_hosts_when` - (Required) Controls Session Host shutdown behaviour during Ramp-Down period. Session Hosts can either be shutdown when all sessions on the Session Host have ended, or when there are no Active sessions left on the Session Host. Possible values are `ZeroSessions` and `ZeroActiveSessions`.
- `ramp_down_wait_time_minutes` - (Required) The number of minutes during Ramp-Down period that autoscale will wait after setting the session host VMs to drain mode, notifying any currently signed in users to save their work before forcing the users to logoff. Once all user sessions on the session host VM have been logged off, Autoscale will shut down the VM.
- `ramp_up_capacity_threshold_percent` - (Optional) This is the value of percentage of used host pool capacity that will be considered to evaluate whether to turn on/off virtual machines during the ramp-up and peak hours. For example, if capacity threshold is specified as `60%` and your total host pool capacity is `100` sessions, autoscale will turn on additional session hosts once the host pool exceeds a load of `60` sessions.
